For example, say your goal is to pay off a colossal credit card bill. You might cut back on takeout dinners and use the money you save to make extra payments instead. Without establishing that goal, you’re more likely to continue spending as usual while your debt piles up."}}},{"dedicated_theme_section_image":"","dedicated_theme_section_heading":"Types of Financial Goals","dedicated_theme_section_description":" <p>Although you can have a wide variety of goals, you can broadly classify each of these goals within a specific time frame so that your priorities become clear.
